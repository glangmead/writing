abstract = "This paper investigates aspects of measure and randomness in the context of locale theory (point-free topology). We prove that every measure (σ-continuous valuation) μ, on the σ-frame of opens of a fitted σ-locale X, extends to a measure on the lattice of all σ-sublocales of X (Theorem 1). Furthermore, when μ is a finite measure with μ(X)=M, the σ-locale X has a smallest σ-sublocale of measure M (Theorem 2). In particular, when μ is a probability measure, X has a smallest σ-sublocale of measure 1. All σ prefixes can be dropped from these statements whenever X is a strongly Lindelöf locale, as is the case in the following applications. When μ is the Lebesgue measure on the Euclidean space Rn, Theorem 1 produces an isometry-invariant measure that, via the inclusion of the powerset P(Rn) in the lattice of sublocales, assigns a weight to every subset of Rn. (Contradiction is avoided because disjoint subsets need not be disjoint as sublocales.) When μ is the uniform probability measure on Cantor space {0,1}ω, the smallest measure-1 sublocale, given by Theorem 2, provides a canonical locale of random sequences, where randomness means that all probabilistic laws (measure-1 properties) are satisfied."

abstract = {The complexity and the randomness aspect of a set of natural numbers are closely related. Traditionally, computability theory is concerned with the complexity aspect. However, computability theoretic tools can also be used to introduce mathematical counterparts for the intuitive notion of randomness of a set. Recent research shows that, conversely, concepts and methods originating from randomness enrich computability theory. The book is about these two aspects of sets of natural numbers and about their interplay. For the first aspect, lowness and highness properties of sets are introduced. For the second aspect, firstly randomness of finite objects are studied, and then randomness of sets of natural numbers. A hierarchy of mathematical randomness notions is established. Each notion matches the intuition idea of randomness to some extent. The advantages and drawbacks of notions weaker and stronger than Martin-Löf randomness are discussed. The main topic is the interplay of the computability and randomness aspects. Research on this interplay has advanced rapidly in recent years. One chapter focuses on injury-free solutions to Post's problem. A core chapter contains a comprehensible treatment of lowness properties below the halting problem, and how they relate to K triviality. Each chapter exposes how the complexity properties are related to randomness. The book also contains analogs in the area of higher computability theory of results from the preceding chapters, reflecting very recent research.},

convex sets to X - satisfying three simple axioms. While an individual Chen
space can be much worse than a smooth manifold, the category of all Chen spaces
is much better behaved than the category of smooth manifolds. For example, any
subspace or quotient space of a Chen space is a Chen space, and the space of
smooth maps between Chen spaces is again a Chen space. Souriau's "diffeological
spaces" share these convenient properties. Here we give a unified treatment of
both formalisms. Following ideas of Dubuc, we show that Chen spaces,
diffeological spaces, and even simplicial complexes are examples of "concrete
sheaves on a concrete site". As a result, the categories of such spaces are
locally cartesian closed, with all limits, all colimits, and a weak subobject
classifier. For the benefit of differential geometers, our treatment explains
most of the category theory we use.},

connections on fiber bundles and of gauge fields -- abstractly in the context
of a certain class of higher toposes that we call "cohesive". Cocycles in this
differential cohomology classify higher principal bundles equipped with
cohesive structure (topological, smooth, synthetic differential,
supergeometric, etc.) and equipped with connections, hence higher gauge fields.
We discuss various models of the axioms and applications to fundamental notions
and constructions in quantum field theory and string theory. In particular we
show that the cohesive and differential refinement of universal characteristic
cocycles constitutes a higher Chern-Weil homomorphism refined from secondary
caracteristic classes to morphisms of higher moduli stacks of higher gauge
fields, and at the same time constitutes extended geometric prequantization --
in the sense of extended/multi-tiered quantum field theory -- of hierarchies of
higher dimensional Chern-Simons-type field theories, their higher
Wess-Zumino-Witten-type boundary field theories and all further higher
codimension defect field theories. We close with an outlook on the
cohomological quantization of such higher boundary prequantum field theories by
a kind of cohesive motives.},

This is a field which every differential geometer has met several times, but which is not treated in detail in one place. Let us explain a little, what we mean by naturality. Exterior derivative commutes with the pullback of differential forms. In the background of this statement are the following general concepts. The vector bundle A kT* M is in fact the value of a functor, which associates a bundle over M to each manifold M and a vector bundle homomorphism over f to each local diffeomorphism f between manifolds of the same dimension. This is a simple example of the concept of a natural bundle. The fact that exterior derivative d transforms sections of A kT* M into sections of A k+1T* M for every manifold M can be expressed by saying that d is an operator from A kT* M into A k+1T* M.},

For example, only manifolds of dimension four can exhibit infinitely many distinct smooth structures.

The third part reviews complex surfaces as an important source of examples. The fourth and final part of the book presents gauge theory. This differential-geometric method has brought to light the unwieldy nature of smooth 4-manifolds; and although the method brings new insights, it has raised more questions than answers. {\textless}P{\textgreater}The structure of the book is modular and organized into a main track of approximately 200 pages, which are augmented with copious notes at the end of each chapter, presenting many extra details, proofs, and developments.
