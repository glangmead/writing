  url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.1704v4},
  abstract = {A "Chen space" is a set X equipped with a collection of "plots" - maps from
convex sets to X - satisfying three simple axioms. While an individual Chen
space can be much worse than a smooth manifold, the category of all Chen spaces
is much better behaved than the category of smooth manifolds. For example, any
subspace or quotient space of a Chen space is a Chen space, and the space of
smooth maps between Chen spaces is again a Chen space. Souriau's "diffeological
spaces" share these convenient properties. Here we give a unified treatment of
both formalisms. Following ideas of Dubuc, we show that Chen spaces,
diffeological spaces, and even simplicial complexes are examples of "concrete
sheaves on a concrete site". As a result, the categories of such spaces are
locally cartesian closed, with all limits, all colimits, and a weak subobject
classifier. For the benefit of differential geometers, our treatment explains
most of the category theory we use.},

generalize the traditional theory to a range of enhanced contexts, such as
super-geometry, higher (stacky) differential geometry, or even a combination of

solving the open problem of covariant geometric pre-quantization of locally
variational field theories, which may include fermions and (higher) gauge
fields. (abridged)},

  title = {Differential cohomology in a cohesive infinity-topos},
  url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.7930v1},
  abstract = {We formulate differential cohomology and Chern-Weil theory -- the theory of
connections on fiber bundles and of gauge fields -- abstractly in the context
of a certain class of higher toposes that we call "cohesive". Cocycles in this
differential cohomology classify higher principal bundles equipped with
cohesive structure (topological, smooth, synthetic differential,
supergeometric, etc.) and equipped with connections, hence higher gauge fields.
We discuss various models of the axioms and applications to fundamental notions
and constructions in quantum field theory and string theory. In particular we
show that the cohesive and differential refinement of universal characteristic
cocycles constitutes a higher Chern-Weil homomorphism refined from secondary
caracteristic classes to morphisms of higher moduli stacks of higher gauge
fields, and at the same time constitutes extended geometric prequantization --
in the sense of extended/multi-tiered quantum field theory -- of hierarchies of
higher dimensional Chern-Simons-type field theories, their higher
Wess-Zumino-Witten-type boundary field theories and all further higher
codimension defect field theories. We close with an outlook on the
cohomological quantization of such higher boundary prequantum field theories by
a kind of cohesive motives.},

This is a field which every differential geometer has met several times, but which is not treated in detail in one place. Let us explain a little, what we mean by naturality. Exterior derivative commutes with the pullback of differential forms. In the background of this statement are the following general concepts. The vector bundle A kT* M is in fact the value of a functor, which associates a bundle over M to each manifold M and a vector bundle homomorphism over f to each local diffeomorphism f between manifolds of the same dimension. This is a simple example of the concept of a natural bundle. The fact that exterior derivative d transforms sections of A kT* M into sections of A k+1T* M for every manifold M can be expressed by saying that d is an operator from A kT* M into A k+1T* M.},

Graduate students, nonexperts, and experts alike will enjoy browsing through it." {\textless}P{\textgreater}-- Robion C. Kirby, University of California Berkeley {\textless}P{\textgreater}This is a panorama of the topology of simply-connected smooth manifolds of dimension four. {\textless}P{\textgreater}Dimension four is unlike any other dimension; it is large enough to have room for wild things to happen, but too small to have room to undo them. For example, only manifolds of dimension four can exhibit infinitely many distinct smooth structures. Indeed, their topology remains the least understood today. {\textless}P{\textgreater}The first part of the book puts things in context with a survey of higher dimensions and of topological 4-manifolds. The second part investigates the main invariant of a 4-manifold--the intersection form--and its interaction with the topology of the manifold. The third part reviews complex surfaces as an important source of examples. The fourth and final part of the book presents gauge theory. This differential-geometric method has brought to light the unwieldy nature of smooth 4-manifolds; and although the method brings new insights, it has raised more questions than answers. {\textless}P{\textgreater}The structure of the book is modular and organized into a main track of approximately 200 pages, which are augmented with copious notes at the end of each chapter, presenting many extra details, proofs, and developments. To help the reader, the text is peppered with over 250 illustrations and has an extensive index.},
