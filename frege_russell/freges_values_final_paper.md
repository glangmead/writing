# Frege's Values
In the 1890s Gottlob Frege expanded the power and scope of logic. His stated narrative was to show that the natural numbers could be created inside logic. But why was he doing this? What benefits did he think this would have and what value statements did he provide? I will show that what Frege valued, as well as his methods for furthering those values, are consistent with some major streams of mathematical activity today. In particular we must continue to enhance logic and foundational theory while maintaining the perspective that this work must also serve the flourishing of other mathematical activity. These ideas provide a framework for tackling the new crisis faced by mathematics. Ironically, this is not another instance of the crises of the 19th and 20th centuries, where mathematics required a renewed commitment to rigor in order to avoid confusion, paradoxes, or errors. There are indeed vocal elements today who claim that we are in just such a crisis! But this time we have all the tools we need to achieve the desired standards. Unfortunately, the proponents of those very tools have themselves brought about a crisis of values, by inviting agents from the nihilistic wing of the artificial intelligence community to harmfully launder their commercial clout into the genuine intellectual clout of mathematics. What we need now is a new commitment to Frege's even bigger vision: that rigor is a tool of mathematics, not a value unto itself.ðŸ”¥

## Type theory
### Synthesis of Frege and Hilbert

## Proof assistants
### And their communities
1. Wonderful working example of Frege's vision. Moving very rapidly. Symbiosis alive and well.
2. But they are a little too welcoming to Szegedy and DeepMind.

## Silicon Reckoner
### Grappling with what mathematical activity is, in a defensive posture wrought by recent capitalist history.
