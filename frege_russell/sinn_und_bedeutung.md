# Sense and Reference (1892)

On this reading, the paper _Sense and Reference_ made a little less sense than previous attempts. I suspect it may be because I find the core idea so natural that the additional examples and scope of the later sections feels like overreach.

The central example of this paper is to compare

    a = a

from

    a = b

where an illustrative example of a = b might be Frege's triangle with bisecting diagonals: draw a line from each vertex, which bisects the opposite side. These three segments meet at a point in the middle:

and so we can form "the point of intersection of a and b" and "the point of intersection of b and c", and these end up being the same point as each other, but something about these two descriptions differs. He calls it

> a difference in the mode of presentation

or 

> different designations for the same point

Or "sign" versus "signified". He appaars to assume that the _signified_ part is more intuitive for the reader, and so he wants to split off the sign, the sense, the mode of presentation.

> besides that which the sign designates, which may be called the _Bedeutung_ of the sign, also what I should like to call the _sense_ of the sign, wherein the mode of presentation is contained.

> The _Bedeutung_ of 'Evening Star' would be the same as that of 'Morning Star', but not the sense.

He makes a couple clarifications.

> The words 'the celestial body most distant from the Earth' have a sense, but it is very doubtful if they also have a _Bedeutung_.

> Comprehensive knowledge of the _Bedeutung_ would require us to be able to say immediately whether any given sense attaches to it. To such knowledge we never attain.

A third term he wants to keep separate is "idea", which is subjective and private to each person.

He compares the actual Moon to a reference, the image it makes in the optics of a telescope to the sense, and the image it makes in one person's retina the idea. He has no interest in ideas going forward.

An assertion, or proposition, has as its reference a truth value. So every True assertion has the same reference!

Frege requires his theories to pass the test that the reference of a sentence must remain unchanged when we replace part of the sentence with a new part that has the same reference as the original part. 

Since a proposition has only True or False as its reference, obliteration all the information, we must be interested not just in the reference but also in the sense. But we are also interested in the reference!

Frege goes on a bit of a grammatical tangent, and this is what confuses me. He spends time on subordinate sentences, since this is a nested structure.

Other cases he considers:

1. An abstract noun clause introduced by "that", prefixed by "say", "hear", "be of the opinion", "be convinced", "conclude", "and similar words". In this case, it is not equivalent to replace the sub-sentence by one of equivalent reference, but rather only of equivalent sense. Perhaps it is because this sub-sentence has as its reference "the thought that this sentence is true." rather than referring directly to True.
2. Subordinate clauses that do have references (but not truth values), e.g. "Whoever discovered the elliptic form of the planetary orbits died in misery." Here the "whoever" clause has Kepler as reference.
3. What if the term "Kepler" fails to refer to anything? Language allows this. This is an imperfection of language.

> It is therefore by no means unimportant to eliminate the source of these mistakes, at least in science, once and for all.

4. Subordinate clauses beginning with "although".

I want to pause on this one. He says 

> This conjunction actually has no senseand does not change the sense of the clause but only illuminates it in a peculiar fashion. 

I'm distressed that his notion of "sense" does not allow the word "although" to do more. It was this eliding of "although" that led me to wonder if the superior framing to Frege's goals is not a dichotomy but rather a spectrum. If we are allowed to nest sense inside larger senses, then the "although" could be a box that wraps the rest of the clause and adds... whatever we decide "although" is adding.

Similarly, his brief attempt to grapple with all the subtleties and implications of 

    'Napoleon, who recognized the danger to his right flank, himself led his guards against the enemy position.'

seems not to worry him, even though he is clearly opening a can of worms here. I don't doubt that everything can be mapped to his framework, but he doesn't seem to acknowledge that language is very complex, and that we can have modes such as sarcasm, various kinds of incorrectness, mixed messages, contradictory thoughts, and so on.

His moral is

> ...the sense of the sentence, viz., the thought expressed by it, is no less relevant than its _Bedeutung_, i.e. its truth-value.
