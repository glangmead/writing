# Concept and Object (1892)

This paper was written as a response to a series of papers by Benno Kerry, which series Frege claims was

> at least partly based on a misunderstanding

The disagreement is about the meaning of Frege's term "concept" and how this differs from an object. Kerry appears to believe that a concept is an object and that the ideas are indistinguishable. But Frege clears things up with the following example:

> the concept of _horse_ is not a concept

it is an object! It gets converted by referring to it in this way. Concepts are predicates, i.e. functions, i.e. unsaturated things.

Another helpful example is

> In the sentence 'There is at least one square root of 4' it is impossible to replace the words 'square root of 4' by 'the concept _square root of 4_'

There's a lot of less direct discussion of all of these issues.

One nugget is

> Second-level concepts, which concepts fall under, are essentially different from first-level concepts, which objects fall under.

And he also clarifies his definition of _mark_:

> If the object Γ has the properties Φ, X and Ψ, I may combine them into Ω, so that it is the same thing if I say that Γ has the property Ω, or that Γ has the properties Φ, X and Ψ. I then call Φ, X and Ψ marks of the concept Ω, and, at the same time, properties of Γ.
