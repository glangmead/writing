# Foundations of Arithmetic (1884)

The subtitle is "a logico-mathematical investigation into the concept of number." The goal is to establish logical foundations for numbers and for arithmetic.

## Introduction

Frege sets out to establish what the number one is, and the other whole numbers. He has a few straw men to rule out first!

> If we ask what the number one is, or what the symbol 1 means, we are more often than not given the answer: a thing.

This task is important:

> Yet is it not shameful that a science should be so unclear about its most prominent object,

He wants to accomplish the task using existing, and _more fundamental_ logical constructions:

> there is no need of special laws for aggregative thought.

Straw man 1: Numbers do not need foundations, as they can be manipulated mechanically and without thought:

> Admittedly, it is possible to manipulate numerals mechanically, just as it is possible to speak like a parrot; but that can scarcely be called thinking. It only becomes possible after mathematical symbolism has been so developed, through genuine thinking, that it does the thinking for us, so to speak.

The foundations of mathematics are to be _philosophical_:

> Admittedly, this has led me to take a more philosophical approach than many mathematicians may deem appropriate; but a fundamental investigation of the concept of number will inevitably turn out to be somewhat philosophical. The task is shared by mathematics and philosophy.

Straw man 2: numbers emerge from physical sensations, like seeing two items, or sensations of touch:

> No, arithmetic has nothing at all to do with sensations. Just as little has it to do with mental images, compounded from the traces of earlier sense impressions.

Straw man 3: numbers are defined by how we think of them, they are psychological constructions:

> The description of the origin of an idea should not be taken for a definition, nor should the account of the mental and physical conditions for becoming aware of a proposition be taken for a proof, and nor should the discovery [Gedachtwerden] of a proposition be confused with its truth! (Platonism?)

Frege has three principles that will guide his thinking:

> In this investigation I have adhered to the following fundamental principles:
> There must be a sharp separation of the psychological from the logical, the subjective from the objective;
> The meaning of a word must be asked for in the context of a proposition, not in isolation; 
> The distinction between concept and object must be kept in mind.

## Main body: 1–4

Frege sees in the Zeitgeist that he lives in a period where the foundations of mathematics are being shored up; where intellectual debt has accrued and is being paid down by a special effort:

> The concepts of function, continuity, limit and infinity have been shown to require sharper definition. Negative and irrational numbers, which have long been accepted in science, have had to submit to a more exacting test of their legitimacy. Thus everywhere efforts are being made to provide rigorous proofs,

He identifies the importance of _proof_ in mathematics in particular:

> But it lies deep in the nature of mathematics always to prefer proof, wherever it is possible, to inductive confirmation,

An interesting point is that the corpus of proofs link to each other and form a network of dependencies:

> The aim of proof is not only to place the truth of a proposition beyond all doubt, but also to afford insight into the dependence of truths on one another.

Frege is going to take on Kant's claims that arithmetic laws are _synthetic a priori_ truths (he will show that they are analytic, not synthetic):

> Questions as to the a priori or a posteriori, synthetic or analytic nature of arithmetical truths here await their answer.

He frames the stakes as being about _why_ something is true:

> [being a posteriori or analytic are] about the ultimate ground on which the justification for holding it to be true rests.

## Part I: 5–8

> Frege argues against Kant that the lack of self-evidence of complex numerical formulae such as ‘135664 + 37863 = 173527’ shows not that they are synthetic but that they are provable (Beaney)

Frege offers a spoiler that he will boil the numbers down to 1 and the successor relation:

> Defining every number in terms of its predecessor allows us to reduce the infinite set of numbers to the number one and the successor relation.

Straw man 4: arithmetic is an inductive result, from empirical data (Mill):

> Frege argues against Mill’s view that the truth of ‘3 = 2 + 1’ depends on the empirical possibility of separating three objects, say, °,°, into two parts, thus, oo o.

In fact, arithmetic cannot be an outgrowth of induction, because it's the other way around!:

> Induction itself, if understood as involving judgements of probability, presupposes arithmetic.

Beaney points out that Leibniz apparently shared the view that artithmetic is analytic.

## Part II: 29–44

Straw man 5: number is a property of objects, such as solidity or color:

> what Number we ascribe to something depends on our way of viewing it. The Iliad, for example, can be thought of as one poem, or as twenty-four Books, (Beaney)

Frege installs numbers as something _objective_ (real) but not _actual_ (present in physical reality). So, Platonic:

> Both the axis of the Earth and the centre of mass of the solar system are objective, but they are not actual like the Earth itself. What is objective is what is law-governed, conceiyable and judgeable — independent of sensation, intuition and imagination, but not of reason, as Frege characterizes it. (Beaney)

## Part III: 29–33

Straw man 6: numbers are sets. I'm not sure what the full statement of the straw man is. Perhaps "the number 6 is a set with six elements".

> Frege poses a dilemma for the view that numbers are sets...there will be as many twos, say, as there are different pairs of objects in the universe. (Beaney)

Some more ruminations on what the number one is:

> The word ‘one’, as the proper name of an object of mathematical inquiry, does not admit of a plural. It therefore makes no sense to let numbers result from the combination of ones. The plus sign in 1 + 1 = 2 cannot mean such a combination.

Here's his definition of a number. It depends on the notion of a "concept":

> [a number is] a statement of number contains an assertion about a concept

> Only concepts, under which the physical and mental, the spatial and temporal, the non-spatial and non-temporal are brought, are ascribed numbers.

What is a concept?:

> As soon as a word is used with the indefinite article, or in the plural without an article, it is a concept word

Along the way he will knock down the ontological proof of the existence of God. This is because there is a dichotomy between concepts and actual items in the universe.

> Since existence is a property of concepts, the ontological proof of the existence of God fails in its aim. But oneness [Fingigkeit] is just as little a mark of the concept ‘God’ as existence. Oneness cannot be used to define this concept any more than strength, spaciousness and homeliness can be used together with stones, mortar and beams to build a house.

Concepts can form a hierarchy, like "the concept of the concepts that have one instance.":

> If, for example, all concepts under which only one object falls, are collected under one concept, then oneness is a mark of this concept...Thus a concept can fall under a higher one, that is to say, a concept of second order.

## Part IV: 55–999

Straw man 7: an honest stab at a three-part definition of numbers:

Def: the number 0 belongs to a concept if, whatever a may be, the proposition holds universally that a does not fall under that concept.

Def: the number 1 belongs to a concept F if, whatever a may be, the proposition does not hold universally that a does not fall under F, and if from the propositions ‘a falls under F’ and ‘b falls under F’ it follows universally that a and b are the same.

Def: the number (n + 1) belongs to the concept F if there is an object a falling under F such that the number n belongs to the concept ‘falling under F, but not a’.

Now he starts to analyze this setup and find problems with it. First, it seems to allow non-numbers to be included:

> but we can never — to take an extreme example — decide by means of our definitions whether the number Julius Caesar belongs to a concept, or whether that well-known conqueror of Gaul is a number or not.

Second, it doesn't imply that 0 != 1:

> does not allow us to distinguish 0 and 1 here as independent, reidentifiable objects.

> Only in a proposition do the words really have a meaning. The mental pictures that may pass before us need not correspond to the logical components of the judgement. It is enough if the proposition as a whole has a sense; its parts thereby also obtain their content.
