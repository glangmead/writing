\p{We follow [[shulman_cohesion]] and [[myers_fibrations]]. The modal operator #{\shape} is a reflection from #{\Type} into discrete types #{\Type_{\shape}}. Its unit #{(-)^{\shape}:X\to \shape X} is implemented as a constructor of a higher inductive type that has four additional constructors. These four constructors assume the existence of a family of types #{R_i} that act collectively as a type of Dedekind real numbers, and they create left and right inverses to the map #{\mathsf{const}:X\to (R_i\to X)}.}
