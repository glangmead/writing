# Structural scratch work

Leibniz rule: how are we multiplying functions? Mapping into an h-space?
Define d <=> specifying f on n-paths via f on n-1-paths

- Q: volume form, duality

- gauge freedom (adding an exact form to A)
  - is this "just" adding to the 0-level?

- vision
  - vectors are paths
  - forms are functions
  - ap moves up a dimension like d
  - mapping into classifying spaces encodes bundles, transport, and curvature
  - a bundle like the tangent bundle of the sphere should have Euler characteristic 2
  - a bundle like the Hopf bundle...
  - characteristic classes are computable with a Chern-Weil approach
  - results align with Freed-Hopkins
