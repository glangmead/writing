\section{Combinatorial manifolds}

We will adapt to higher inductive types in a straightforward manner the classical construction of \emph{combinatorial manifolds}. See for example the classic book by Kirby and Siebenmann\cite{kirby_siebenmann}. These are a subclass of simplicial complexes.

\begin{mydef}
An \defemph{abstract simplicial complex \( M \) of dimension \( n \)} consists of a set \( M_0 \) of vertices, and for each \( 0<k\leq n \) a set \( M_k \) of subsets of \( M_0 \) of cardinality \( k+1 \), such that any \( (j+1) \)-element subset of \( M_k \) is an element of \( M_j \). The elements of \( M_k \) are called \defemph{\( k \)-faces}. Denote by \( \simcomp \) the type of abstract simplicial complexes of dimension \( n \) (where the suffix \( \mathsf{Set} \) reminds us that this is a type of sets).
\end{mydef}

Note that we don't require all subsets of \( M_0 \) to be included -- that would make \( M \) an individual simplex. A simplicial complex is a family of simplices that are identified along various faces.

\begin{mydef}
In an abstract simplicial complex \( M \) of dimension \( n \), the \defemph{link} of a vertex \( v \) is the \( n-1 \)-face containing every face \( m\in M_{n-1} \) such that \( v\notin m \) and \( m\cup v \) is an \( n \)-face of \( M \).
\end{mydef}

The link is all the neighboring vertices of \( v \) and the codimension 1 faces joining those to each other. See for example Figure~\ref{fig:link}.

\caption{The link of \( v \) in this complex consists of the vertices \( \{a,b,c,d,e,f\} \) and the edges \( \{ab,bc,cd,de,ef,fa\} \), forming a hexagon.}
\label{fig:link}
\end{figure}

\begin{mydef}
A \defemph{combinatorial manifold} (or \defemph{combinatorial triangulation}) of dimension \( n \) is a simplicial complex of dimension \( n \) such that the link of every vertex is a simplicial sphere of dimension \( n-1 \) (i.e. its geometric realization is homeomorphic to an \( n-1 \)-sphere). Denote by \( \combmfdset \) the type of combinatorial manifolds of dimension \( n \) (which the notation again reminds us are sets).
\end{mydef}

In a 2-dimensional combinatorial manifold the link is a polygon. See Figures~\ref{fig:sphere_triangulation}, \ref{fig:torus_wiki_triangulation}, and \ref{fig:genus3_wiki_triangulation} for some examples of 2-dimensional combinatorial manifolds of genus 0, 1, and 3.

A classical 1940 result of Whitehead, building on Cairn, states that every smooth manifold admits a combinatorial triangulation\cite{whitehead_triangulation}. So it appears reasonably well motivated to study this class of objects.

\subsection{Higher inductive combinatorial manifolds}

We will convert a simplicial complex \( M \) of dimension at most 2 to a higher inductive type, in two steps. 

\begin{mydef}
Define \( \combmfdt \) to be the type of \defemph{higher inductive constructors of combinatorial manifolds of dimension at most 2} and let \( \mathcal{H}:\combmfdsett\to\combmfdt \) be a map from a combinatorial manifold to such a HIT following this method:
\begin{enumerate}
\item vertices: a function \( \mathsf{v_0}:M_0\to \mathcal{H}(M) \) serving as the 0-dimensional constructors
\item edges: a function \( \mathsf{v_1} \) on 1-faces, sending \( \{a, b\}\mapsto \mathsf{v_0}(a)=\mathsf{v_0}(b) \)
\item 2-faces: a function \( \mathsf{v_2} \) on 2-faces, sending \( \{a, b, c\}\mapsto \refl_a = \mathsf{v_1}(\{a, b\})\cdot \mathsf{v_1}(\{b, c\})\cdot \mathsf{v_1}(\{a, c\})^{-1} \).
\end{enumerate}
\end{mydef}

We will assume there is a rigorous theory of such HITs, and that at least up to dimension 2 there are no obstructions to simply copying over the combinatorial data to the HIT constructors. See for example David Wärn's recent work on pushouts\cite{warn_pushouts}.

\begin{mydef}
Denote by \( \mathcal{R}:\combmfdt\to\Type \) the process of generating a type from the HIT data (which we refer to as \defemph{realization}). Note that \( \mathcal{R}(\mathcal{H}(M)) \) is not in general a set, and may not even be 2-truncated for an arbitrary 2-dimensional combinatorial manifold \( M:\combmfdsett \).
\end{mydef}

We're making the distinction between \( \mathcal{H} \) and \( \mathcal{R} \) because we will work so closely with the constructors when we map out of them, but of course type theory tells us that to define a map out of the type \( \mathcal{R}(\mathcal{H}(M)) \) we just have to define it on the constructors, so the distinction is not very sharp.

\subsection{Polygons}\label{sec:polygons}

We will now start looking at some examples, first by defining a type that is important both for the domain and the codomain of mere circles: a square.

\begin{mydef}
The higher inductive type \( C_4 \) (where C stands for ``circle'').
\begin{align*}
C_4 &: \Type \\
c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4 &: C_4 \\
c_1c_2 &: c_1 = c_2 \\
c_2c_3 &: c_2 = c_3 \\
c_3c_4 &: c_3 = c_4 \\
c_4c_1 &: c_4 = c_1 \\
\end{align*}
\end{mydef}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\input{discrete_gauge_theory_c4_tikz}
\caption{The HIT \( C_4 \).}
\end{figure}

The standard HoTT circle itself is a non-example of a combinatorial manifold since it lacks the second vertex of the edge:

\begin{mydef}
The higher inductive type \( \so \):
\begin{align*}
\so &:\Type \\
\mathsf{base}&:\so \\
\mathsf{loop}&:\mathsf{base}=\mathsf{base}
\end{align*}
\end{mydef}

Nonetheless, all polygons are equivalent to each other and to \( \so \).

\begin{mylemma}
\label{lem:c4equiv}
Define the function \( \ell:C_4\to\so \) by
\begin{align*}
\ell(c_i)&=\mathsf{base}, i=1, 2, 3, 4 \\
\ell(c_1c_2)&=\mathsf{loop} \\
\ell(c_2c_3)=\ell(c_3c_4)=\ell(c_4c_1)&=\refl_{\mathsf{base}}
\end{align*}
and define the function \( s_1:\so\to C_4 \) by \( s_1(\mathsf{base})=c_1 \) and \( s_1(\mathsf{loop})=c_1c_2\cdot c_2c_3\cdot c_3c_4\cdot c_4c_1 \). (The subscript on \( s_1 \) reminds us that we chose vertex \( c_1 \) to map \( \mathsf{base} \) to.) Then \( \ell \) and \( s_1 \) constitute an equivalence \( \mathsf{c4\_equiv}:\mathsf{is_equiv}(\ell,s_1) \).
\end{mylemma}
\begin{proof}
We need \( \pit{x:C_4}s_1(\ell(x))=x \) and \( \pit{y:S^1}\ell(s_1(y))=y \).
\end{proof}

Recalling that terms of \( \EMzo \) are pairs: a type, and a mere equivalence with \( \so \), we have:

\begin{mycor}
We have \( (C_4,||\mathsf{c4\_equiv}||_{-1}):\EMzo. \)
\end{mycor}

More claims: given some other square \( abcd \) and an equivalence with \( C_4 \), we get a path in \( \EMzo \). This includes automorphisms of \( C_4 \). For example \( R \). Furthermore there is a homotopy from \( R \) to the identity, which give a 2-path \( \refl_{C_4}=R \) in the universe.

Real-world triangulations of surfaces will often have links whose number of vertices varies across the surface. For example we can see hexagons and pentagons in Figure~\ref{fig:sphere_triangulation}. This presumably introduces only a minor practical inconvenience and doesn't materially affect the discussion to come.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{The higher inductive type \( \oo \)}{The higher inductive type O}}

We will create our first combinatorial surface, a 2-sphere. We will adopt the convention that a subscript indicates the dimension of a subskeleton of a complex. For instance, we have \( \mathsf{base}:\so_0 \).

\begin{mydef}
The HIT \( \oo_0 \) is just 6 points, intended as the 0-skeleton of an octahedron, with vertices named after the colors on the faces of a famous Central European puzzle cube.
\[ w, y, b, r, g, o : \oo_0 \]
\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef}
The HIT \( \oo_1 \) is the 1-skeleton of an octahedron.
\begin{align*}
w, y, b, r, g, o &: \oo_1 & yg &: y=g \\
wb &: w=b & yo &: y=o \\
wr &: w=r & br &: b=r \\
wg &: w=g & rg &: r=g \\
wo &: w=o & go &: g=o \\
yb &: y=b & ob &: o=b \\
yr &: y=r
\end{align*}
\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef}
The HIT \( \oo \) is an octahedron:
\begin{align*}
w, y, b, r, g, o &: \oo \\
wb &: w=b & br &: b=r & wbr &: wb\cdot br\cdot wr^{-1} = \refl_w \\
wr &: w=r & rg &: r=g & wrg &: wr\cdot rg\cdot wg^{-1} = \refl_w \\
wg &: w=g & go &: g=o & wgo &: wg\cdot go\cdot wo^{-1} = \refl_w \\
wo &: w=o & ob &: o=b & wob &: wo\cdot ob\cdot wb^{-1} = \refl_w \\
yb &: y=b & & & yrb &: yr\cdot rb\cdot yb^{-1} = \refl_y \\
yr &: y=r & & & ygr &: yg\cdot gr\cdot yr^{-1} = \refl_y \\
yg &: y=g & & & yog &: yo\cdot og\cdot yg^{-1} = \refl_y \\
yo &: y=o & & & ybo &: yb\cdot bo\cdot yo^{-1} = \refl_y 
\end{align*}
\end{mydef}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\input{discrete_gauge_theory_oo_tikz}
\caption{The HIT \( \oo \) which has 6 points, 12 1-paths, 8 2-paths.}
\end{figure}

We have obvious maps \( \oo_0\xrightarrow[]{i_0} \oo_1\xrightarrow[]{i_1} \oo \) that include each skeleton into the next-higher-dimensional skeleton.

\subsection{Groupoid operations on higher inductive combinatorial manifolds}

Let \( M:\simcompt \) be a combinatorial 2-manifold and \( \mm\defeq\mathcal{H}(M):\combmfdt \) the corresponding higher inductive type. \( \mm \) has triangular 2-faces just as \( M \) does, except they are 2-paths in the HoTT sense. If two faces \( bca \) and \( bdc \) share the edge \( bc \) (see Figure~\ref{fig:concat}), then we can define some operations that combine the combinatorics of simplices with the higher groupoid operations generated by our HIT. 

Consider the following 2-path from a loop at \( a \) (which traverses the boundary of each triangle) to \( \refl_a \):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:face_concat_paths}
\underbrace{\underbrace{ab\cdot bc\cdot ca}_{=\refl_a}\cdot \underbrace{ab}_{\text{move to }b}\cdot \underbrace{bd\cdot dc\cdot cb}_{=\refl_b}\cdot \underbrace{ba}_{\text{back to }a}}_{=\refl_a}. 
\end{equation}
This 2-path must be definitionally equal to the 4-gon \( abdc:\refl_a=\refl_a \). From this observation we can imagine concatenating additional faces, choosing some strategy for visiting each face in some order \( \{f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_n\} \), and for each face choosing a vertex \( v_i \) in that face and a path \( p_i:a=v_i \) to move from \( a \) to that face.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=200pt]{concat.pdf}
\caption{Concatenating the triangles \( abc \) and \( bdc \) gives the 4-gon \( abdc \).}
\label{fig:concat}
\end{figure}

We will have two use cases for this operation. The first is to consider the concatenation of \emph{all} the faces of \( \mm \), i.e. a term \( f_\mm:\refl_a=\refl_a \) corresponding to \( \mm \) itself. This will play the role of the ``fundamental homology class'' from classical topology, which is an object on which 2-forms can be evaluated to compute their value on the whole manifold. 

\begin{mydef}
\label{def:totalface}
If \( \mm:\combmfdt \) is a combinatorial manifold and \( a:\mm_0 \) is a vertex, a \defemph{total face} of \( \mm \) is a term \( f_\mm:\refl_a=\refl_a \) given by any choice of ordering of the faces \( \{f_i\} \), a vertex \( v_i \) in each face, and terms \( a=v_i \) for each face.
\end{mydef}

The second use case for concatenating faces is to create a HIT related to \( \mm \) but without one of the point constructors. Figure~\ref{fig:hex_concat} illustrates the equivalence.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=200pt]{hex_concat.pdf}
\caption{Concatenating the six triangles in the approrpiate way produces a 2-path in \( \refl_v=\refl_v \).}
\label{fig:hex_concat}
\end{figure}

\begin{mydef}
If \( \mm:\combmfdt \) is a combinatorial manifold and \( Z\subset \mm_0 \) is a set of vertices in \( \mm \) with members \( Z=\{z_0,\ldots,z_n\} \), then denote by \( \mm\setminus Z \) the type given by omitting the vertices in \( Z \) from the constructors in all dimensions where they appeared. Call the points of \( Z \) \defemph{isolated} if no two of them are neighbors, i.e. we have \( \pit{z:Z}\link(z)\cap Z=\emptyset \). In the isolated case \( \mm\setminus Z \) has boundary circles where each vertex was removed.
\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef}
\label{def:replacement}
If we have \( \mm\setminus Z \) for some isolated set of verticies \( Z \), then for each \( z:Z \) we can compose all the faces which contain \( z \), forming a new face (see Figure~\ref{fig:hex_concat}). In this way we produce a HIT called \( \mm_Z \), which is no longer combinatorial. We call \( \mm_Z \) the \defemph{replacement of \( \mm \) without \( Z \)}.
\end{mydef}

\begin{mylemma}
If \( Z \) are isolated points of \( \mm \) then we have \( \mathcal{R}(\mm)=_\Type\mathcal{R}(\mm_Z) \).
\end{mylemma}
\begin{proof}
Concatenating all the faces around a given point \( z:Z \) gives a map \( \mathsf{concat}_z:\mm\to\mathcal{R}(\mm_Z) \). Compose these to form \( \mathsf{concat}\defeq\mathsf{concat}_{z_n}\circ\cdots\mathsf{concat}_{z_1}:\mm\to\mathcal{R}(\mm_Z) \). The rest of the data of \( \mm \) has an obvious inclusion into \( \mm_Z \) and hence \( \mathcal{R}(\mm_Z) \).  In the other direction we map any face bouding a hexagon to the corresponding concatenation of faces in \( \mathcal{R}(\mm) \) and map the rest of the data by the obvious inclusion. We omit the proof that these are inverses.
\end{proof}

\subsection{The function \texorpdfstring{\( T \)}{T}}

We will build up a map \( T \) out of \( \oo \). Taking the link of a vertex gives us a map from vertices to polygons.

\begin{mydef}
\( T_0\defeq\link:\oo_0\to\EMzo \) is given by:
\begin{align*}
\link(w) &= brgo & \link(r) &= wbyg \\
\link(y) &= bogr & \link(g) &= wryo \\
\link(b) &= woyr & \link(o) &= wgyb
\end{align*}
We chose these orderings for the vertices in the link, by visualizing standing at the given vertex as if it were the north pole, then looking south and enumerating the link in clockwise order, starting from \( w \) if possible, else \( b \).
\end{mydef}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\input{discrete_gauge_theory_oo_transport_tikz}
\caption{\( \link \) for the vertices \( w, b\) and \( r \).}
\label{fig:triangle_of_equators}
\end{figure}

To extend \( T_0 \) to a function \( T_1 \) on the 1-skeleton we have complete freedom. In other words, defining a map one dimension at a time makes clear that on a HIT the action on paths is extra structure. Two functions on the octahedron could agree on points but differ on edges. We are going to identify this 1-dimensional freedom with a connection.

Continuing the example, we will do something ``tangent bundley'', imagining how \( T_1 \) changes as we slide from point to point in the embedding shown in the figures. Sliding from \( w \) to \( b \) and tipping the link as we go, we see \( r\mapsto r \) and \( o\mapsto o \) because those lie on the axis of rotation. Then \( g\mapsto w \) and \( b\mapsto y \). 

\begin{mydef}
Define \( T_1:\oo_1\to\EMzo \) on just the 1-skeleton by extending \( T_0 \) as follows:
Transport away from \( w \):
\begin{itemize}
\item \( T_1(wb):[b, r, g, o]\mapsto [y, r, w, o] \) (\( r, o \) fixed)
\item \( T_1(wr):[b, r, g, o]\mapsto [b, y, g, w] \) (\( b, g \) fixed)
\item \( T_1(wg):[b, r, g, o]\mapsto [w, r, y, o] \)
\item \( T_1(wo):[b, r, g, o]\mapsto [b, w, g, y] \)
\end{itemize}
Transport away from \( y \):
\begin{itemize}
\item \( T_1(yb):[b, o, g, r]\mapsto [w, o, y, r] \)
\item \( T_1(yr):[b, o, g, r]\mapsto [b, y, g, w] \)
\item \( T_1(yg):[b, o, g, r]\mapsto [y, o, w, r] \)
\item \( T_1(yo):[b, o, g, r]\mapsto [b, w, g, y] \)
\end{itemize}
Transport along the equator:
\begin{itemize}
\item \( T_1(br):[w, o, y, r]\mapsto [w, b, y, g] \) 
\item \( T_1(rg):[w, b, y, g]\mapsto [w, r, y, o] \)
\item \( T_1(go):[w, r, y, o]\mapsto [w, g, y, b] \)
\item \( T_1(ob):[w, g, y, b]\mapsto [w, o, y, r] \)
\end{itemize}
\end{mydef}

It's very important to be able to visualize what \( T_1 \) does to triangular paths such as \( wb\cdot br\cdot rw \) (which circulates around the boundary of face \( wbr \)). You can see it if you imagine Figure~\ref{fig:triangle_of_equators} as the frames of a short movie. Or you can place your palm over the top of a cube and note where your fingers are pointing, then slide your hand to an equatorial face, then along the equator, then back to the top. The answer is: you come back rotated clockwise by a quarter-turn. 

\begin{mydef}
The map \( R:C_4\to C_4 \) rotates by one quarter turn, one ``click":
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
\item \( R(c_1) = c_2 \)
\item \( R(c_2) = c_3 \)
\item \( R(c_3) = c_4 \)
\item \( R(c_4) = c_1 \)
\item \( R(c_1c_2) = c_2c_3 \)
\item \( R(c_2c_3) = c_3c_4 \)
\item \( R(c_3c_4) = c_4c_1 \)
\item \( R(c_4c_1) = c_1c_2 \)
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}
\end{mydef}

Note that by composing \( R \) with the map \( \mathsf{c4\_equiv} \) from Lemma~\ref{lem:c4equiv} we obtain a loop in the universe, a term of \( C_4=_{\EMzo}C_4 \).

Now let's extend \( T_1 \) to all of \( \oo \) by providing values for the eight faces. The face \( wbr \) is a path from \( \refl_w \) to the concatenation \( wb\cdot br\cdot rw \), and so the image of \( wbr \) under the extended version of \( T_1 \) must be a homotopy from \( \refl_{T_1(w)} \) to \( T_1(wb\cdot br\cdot rw) \). Here \emph{there is no additional freedom}.

\begin{mydef}
Define \( T_2:\oo\to\EMzo \) by extending \( T_1 \) to the faces as follows:
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
\item \( T_2(wbr)=H_R \) 
\item \( T_2(wrg)=H_R \)
\item \( T_2(wgo)=H_R \)
\item \( T_2(ybo)=H_R \)
\item \( T_2(yrb)=H_R \) 
\item \( T_2(ygr)=H_R \)
\item \( T_2(yog)=H_R \)
\item \( T_2(ybo)=H_R \)
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}
where \( H_R:R=\refl \) is the obvious homotopy.
\end{mydef}

If the action of \( T_1 \) on paths is to be a connection, then we clearly see the curvature of that connection in the definition of \( T_2 \) on the triangular 2-paths! We have exactly paralleled the classical definition, where infinitesimal curvature is defined by computing the parallel transport around an infinitesimal loop. 

\begin{mynote}
We have defined a function on a cell by requiring it to correspond to the value on the boundary of that cell. This is familiar in classical differential topology, where it's called \emph{the exterior derivative}. The duality of \( d \) and \( \partial \) is recognizable in \( T_2 \), and we might say ``curvature is the derivative of transport.''
\end{mynote}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\( T \)}{T} on concatenations of faces}

Continuing with the classical analogies, we should seek a way to concatenate the curvature on two or more faces. This would correspond to integrating the curvature 2-form over a 2-cell, including integrating over the whole manifold to compute \emph{total curvature}. Look again at Figure~\ref{fig:concat} where we concatenated two faces that share an edge. HoTT maps respect groupoid operations, so we have
\( T_2(abc\cdot bdc) = T_2(abdc) \). We can double-check this by comparing transport around the 4-gon to transport along a path analogous to
\[ ab\cdot bc\cdot ca\cdot ab \cdot bd\cdot dc\cdot cb \cdot ba \]
that we examined in Equation~\ref{eq:face_concat_paths}.

Here we can take a vertical 4-gon like \( wbyr \).

\begin{mylemma}
\[ 
T_1(wb\cdot by\cdot yr\cdot rw) = T_1(wb\cdot br\cdot rw\cdot wb\cdot by\cdot yr\cdot rb\cdot bw) 
\]
\end{mylemma}
\begin{proof}
Both are equal to \( R^2 \) acting to permute \( \{b, r, g, o\} \) to \( \{g, o, b, r\} \).
\end{proof}

Similarly transport around the other vertical wedges \( wryg \), \( wgyo \) and \( woyb \) are each \( R^2 \), and the four wedges can be composed to obtain \( R^8:\link(w)=\link(w) \). This implies that the total face given by concatenating all 8 faces (in this order) maps by \( T_2 \) to the homotopy that unwinds \( R^8 \) to the identity.

What if we chose another strategy for concatenating the faces of \( \oo \)? Suppose we concatenate all four triangles in the upper hemisphere with \( w \) as the basepoint, then move to \( y \) and compose the four southern triangles, then move back up to \( w \)?
\begin{mylemma}
\[ 
T_1(wb\cdot br\cdot rg\cdot go\cdot ow) = T_1(wb\cdot by\cdot (yr\cdot rb\cdot bo\cdot og\cdot gr\cdot ry)\cdot yb\cdot bw) 
\]
\end{mylemma}
\begin{proof}
Both are equal to \( R^4 \).
\end{proof}
And therefore by concatenating the path on the left with the path on the right we see that this different ordering of the faces gives the same value of \( T_2 \) as before, namely \( R^8 \).

\subsection{The torus}

We can define a combinatorial torus as a similar HIT. This time each vertex will have six neighbors. So all the links will be merely equal to \( C_6 \) which is a hexagonal version of \( C_4 \). See Figure~\ref{fig:torus}. 

To help parse this figure, imagine instead Figure~\ref{fig:flattorus}. We take this simple alternating-triangle pattern, then glue the left and right edges, then bend into Figure~\ref{fig:torus}. The fact that each column in Figure~\ref{fig:flattorus} has four dots corresponds to the torus in Figure~\ref{fig:torus} having a square in front, diamonds in the middle, and a square in back.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

This somewhat arbitrary and unfamiliar model of a torus has the helpful property that it is a combinatorial manifold that is somewhat minimal while still being representable by a donut shape. But the donut-shaped version suggests a very different tangent bundle than the flat model! Starting with the flat model, we can easily see how to define \( T_1 \) by sliding a link rigidly along the page to the link of some adjacent vertex. Then we can see that transport around any loop is the identity and so \( T_2 \) is always the homotopy \( \refl_\id \) from the identity to itself.

The donut-shaped torus suggests a different tangent bundle, one determined by the embedding in 3-space that we have represented. But the easiest way to think about that bundle and its connection and curvature is to wait until we have a proof of the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, so that we can instead use a downward-flowing vector field inspired by Morse theory.

\subsection{Vector fields}

\begin{mydef}
A \defemph{partial function} \( f:A\to B \) is a function \( f:A\to B+\star \), the disjoint union of \( B \) with the 1-element type.
\end{mydef}

If \( T:\mm\to\EMzo \) is a bundle of mere circles, then a vector field should be a partial function \( T_\bullet:\mm\to\EMpzo \) that lifts \( T \). In other words, a pointing of \emph{some} of the fibers. This aligns with the classical picture of a choice of nonzero vector at each point, except for some points where the vector field vanishes. So instead of having some notion of the full tangent space (one candidate for which would be the disk at each point, i.e. \( \link \) plus its spokes and filler triangles) we are mapping some vertices to their circular fibers, and others to \( \star \). This lets us continue to work with \( \EMzo \).

Figure~\ref{fig:flattorus_zero} illustrates what removing a point looks like. The resulting type is no longer a combinatorial manifold, since it fails the condition about every point having a circular link.

\begin{mydef}
Let \( \mm:\combmfdt \) be a combinatorial manifold and \( Z \) an isolated set of vertices. A \defemph{vector field \( X \) on \( \mm \) with zero set \( Z \)} is a partial section of \( P \), i.e. a term \( X:\pit{x:\mm\setminus Z}T(x) \) (and eliding the unique term of \( Z\to\star \)). The \defemph{exponential map} \( \exp:P\to \mm \) is the map sending points in a fiber to the corresponding point in the link of the base point: \( \exp(x, y:\link(x))=y \). In commutative diagram form we have:

Let's see a few examples.

The \defemph{spinning vector field} \( \Xspin \) on \( \oo\setminus\{w, y\} \) is given by the following data. We compose with \( \exp \) to keep the notation directly in \( \oo \). See Figure~\ref{fig:sphere_spin}

To avoid naming every vertex, edge and face of the torus we will just sketch how to define the picture in Figure~\ref{fig:morse_torus}. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\input{discrete_gauge_theory_torus_morse_tikz}
\caption{A vector field on the torus that flows downward, when viewed as a donut. The zeros are represented as missing dots. Every dot has one outgoing vector.}
\label{fig:morse_torus}
\end{figure}%fig:morse_torus

\subsection{Index}

There is a classical concept called the \emph{index} of a vector field \emph{at a zero}. The purpose is to capture whether the zero is a source, a sink, a swirl, or a combination. In Figure~\ref{fig:morse_torus} we see a vector field that has four zeros. 

The picture doesn't capture what is happening on paths and faces, so let's spell it out 

\begin{mydef}
The \defemph{index} of \( X \) at an isolated vertex \( z:Z \) is the \emph{degree} of the map \( \exp\circ\tr:\link(z)\to\link(z) \) (i.e. \( \Omega (\exp\circ\tr)(1):\zz \)). The map \( \tr \) transports \( P \) and \( X \) along the spokes joining the link to the point \( z \). Although \( z \) is not in the domain of \( X \), the hypothesis of \( z \) being isolated implies that the link is in the domain of \( X \).
\end{mydef}

% We will revisit the index later when we discuss the total index. Figure~\ref{fig:flattorus_clock} shows some discrete versions of the classical examples of index +1, --1 and 0. One note: the figures are only illustrating the value of the vector field on vertices. The \( \apd \) operation could in theory spin the vector many times around the link on its way from one vertex to the next. We will assume at all times that the smallest movement is taking place, and we leave it to the imagination whether that movement is clockwise or counterclockwise. A formalization would have to specify this fully of course.
