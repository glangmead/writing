\subsection{Abstract simplicial complexes}

\begin{mydef}
An \defemph{abstract simplicial complex \( M\defeq[M_0,\ldots,M_n] \) of dimension \( n \)} is an ordered list consisting of a set \( M_0 \) of vertices, and for each \( 0<k\leq n \) a set \( M_k \) of subsets of \( M_0 \) of cardinality \( k+1 \), such that any \( (j+1) \)-element subset of \( M_k \) is an element of \( M_j \). The elements of \( M_k \) are called \defemph{\( k \)-faces}. Denote by \( \simcomp \) the type of abstract simplicial complexes of dimension \( n \) (where the suffix \( \mathsf{Set} \) reminds us that this is a type of sets). Let \( M_{\leq k}= [M_0,\ldots,M_k] \) and note that \( M_{\leq n}=M \). We call \( M_{\leq k} \) the \defemph{\( k \)-skeleton} of \( M \), and it is a (\( k \)-)complex in its own right. \( M \) is automatically equipped with a chain of inclusions of the skeleta \( M_0\hookrightarrow M_{\leq 1}\hookrightarrow\cdots\hookrightarrow M_{\leq n}=M \). 
\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef}
Let \( \Delta^n \) be the standard \( n \)-simplex in \( \rr^n \) given by \( \{x_1,\ldots,x_n|\sum_i x_i\leq 1\} \). Let \( M:\simcomp \). The \defemph{geometric realization} \( |M|:\Topcat \) of \( M \) in the category of topological spaces is given inductively as follows: \( |M_0|=M_0 \), and given \( |M_{\leq k-1}| \) we form \( |M_{\leq k}| \) by the pushout in sets
\end{mydef}

\end{center}
which attaches each \( k \)-simplex by taking the convex hull of the appropriate \( k+1 \) points in \( |M_{\leq k-1}| \).
The collection of vertical maps on the right gives a sequence of inclusion maps of skeleta \( |M_0|\xrightarrow[]{i_1}|M_{\leq 1}|\xrightarrow[]{i_2}\cdots\xrightarrow[]{i_n}|M_{\leq n}|=|M| \).

\begin{mydef}
In an abstract simplicial complex \( M \) of dimension \( n \), the \defemph{link} of a vertex \( v \) is the \( n-1 \)-dimensional subcomplex containing every face \( m\in M_{n-1} \) such that \( v\notin m \) and \( m\cup v \) is an \( n \)-face of \( M \).
\label{def:link}
\end{mydef}

The link is easier to understand as all the neighboring vertices of \( v \) and the subcomplex containing these. See for example Figure~\ref{fig:link}.

\label{fig:link}
\end{figure}

\begin{mydef}
A \defemph{combinatorial manifold} (or \defemph{combinatorial triangulation}) of dimension \( n \) is a simplicial complex of dimension \( n \) such that the link of every vertex is a \defemph{simplicial sphere} of dimension \( n-1 \) (meaning its geometric realization is homeomorphic to an \( n-1 \)-sphere). Denote by \( \combmfdset \) the type of combinatorial manifolds of dimension \( n \) (which the notation again reminds us are sets).
\end{mydef}

In a 2-dimensional combinatorial manifold the link is a polygon. See Figures~\ref{fig:sphere_triangulation}, \ref{fig:torus_wiki_triangulation}, and \ref{fig:genus3_wiki_triangulation} for some examples of 2-dimensional combinatorial manifolds of genus 0, 1, and 3.

A classical 1940 result of Whitehead, building on Cairn, states that every smooth manifold admits a combinatorial triangulation\cite{whitehead_triangulation}. So it appears reasonably well motivated to study this class of objects. See for example the classic book by Kirby and Siebenmann\cite{kirby_siebenmann}.

\subsection{Higher inductive combinatorial manifolds}

Instead of \( |M|:\Topcat \) we can use the simplicial complex to obtain \( \mm:\Type \) by forming a sequence of homotopy pushouts:

\begin{mydef}
Define the function \defemph{(higher) realization} \( \re:\simcomp\to\Type \) by performing a homotopy pushout of the data from the geometric realization. The simplex \( \Delta^k \) is contractible up to homotopy so we can omit it.
\end{mydef}

For example in dimension 1 we could take the triangle with vertices \( \{v_1, v_2, v_3\} \) and edges \( \{e_{12}, e_{23}, e_{31}\} \) and form a polygon \( C_3 \):

In dimension 2 we could fill in maps from \( C_3 \) into our higher type by adding faces (hence reusing the object we just built above):

The types \( C_3 \) and \( \mm_1 \) are 1-types, \( \mm_2 \) is a 2-type, and the rest are sets. The map \( \partial_0 \) maps each pair \( (e, S^0) \) to the pair of points this edge connects. Similarly, \( \partial_1 \) maps each \( (f, C_3) \) to the triangle that this face bounds. The \( h_i \) are the proofs of commutativity, and the two squares are also both homotopy pushouts. Note that the pushouts could be re-expressed as HIT constructors.

Whereas in geometric realization we use both \( \Delta^i \) and \( \partial\Delta^i \) to attach simplices, in this homotopy picture we need an explicit construction of ``\( \partial\Delta^i \)'' as a type equivalent to an \( i-1 \)-dimensional sphere and the filling of this sphere with \( i \)-dimensional stuff has moved into the proof of commutativity. So in dimension \( n \) the picture would be

It's useful to define types that remember all or some of the data in these diagrams:

\begin{mydef}
Denote by \( \Typen \) the type of \defemph{presented types of dimension \( n \)}, which consist of a sequence \( \mm_0\to\mm_1\to\cdots\to\mm_n \) and the mere existence of \( M:\simcomp \) and maps \( \partial_i \), \( *_i \) and \( h_i \) as in the previous diagrams.
\end{mydef}

The name ``presented type'' is inspired by von Raumer\cite{vonraumer_nonabelian}, where he uses such a structure in dimension 2 to construct double groupoids and crossed modules in type theory.

\begin{mydef}
Denote by \( \MTypen \) the type of \defemph{marked presented types of dimension \( n \)}, which consists of a complex \( M:\simcomp \) and maps \( \partial_i \), \( *_i \) and \( h_i \) as in the previous diagrams. We clearly have a forgetful map \( \MTypen\to\Typen \).
\end{mydef}

The maps \( *_i:M_i\to\mm_i \) pick out hub terms for each vertex, edge, face, and so on. Each of these higher faces has this designated point and a family of paths joining that point to the entire boundary. This is a hub and spoke model, with the maps \( *_v \) etc. giving us the hubs. When we work with \( \MTypen \) we may access the vertices and faces, and the explicit paths inside the pushouts.

Going forward we will stick with 2-dimensional complexes, where forming the link of a vertex gives us a map \( \mm_0\to\Gon \) exactly when the complex is a combinatorial manifold, which by Corollary~\ref{cor:gon} means we have a map \( \link:\mm_0\to\EMzo \). Extending this map to all of \( \mm \) and exploring what we obtain is the main purpose of this note.

\subsection{Polygons}\label{sec:polygons}

The 1-type \( C_3 \) we created earlier by pushing out the combinatorial data of a set-based simplicial triangle is clearly an example of a type of marked presented polygons \( C_n, n:\nn \). The standard HoTT circle itself is usually given as a HIT and is a non-example of a combinatorial manifold since it lacks the second vertex of the edge:

\begin{mydef}
The higher inductive type \( \so \) which we can also call \( C_1 \):
\begin{align*}
\so &:\Type \\
\mathsf{base}&:\so \\
\mathsf{loop}&:\mathsf{base}=\mathsf{base}
\end{align*}
\end{mydef}

Denote by \( \Gon \) the set of marked presented \( n \)-gons for some natural number \( n \). We'll see below that the realization of an \( n \)-gon is a mere circle, i.e. we have a forgetful map \( \Gon\to \EMzo \).

\subsection{Adding and removing points from polygons}
Recall that given functions \( \phi,\psi:A\to B \) between two arbitrary types we can form a type family of paths \( \alpha:A\to\uni \) by \( \alpha(a)\defeq(\phi(a)=_B\psi(a)) \). Transport in this family is given by concatenation as follows, where \( p:a=_A a' \) and \( q:\phi(a)=\psi(a) \) (see Figure~\ref{fig:transport_family_of_paths}):
\[ 
\tr(p)(q) = \phi(p)^{-1}\cdot q\cdot \psi(p)
\]
which gives a path in \( \phi(a')=\psi(a') \) by connecting dots between the terms \( \phi(a'), \phi(a), \psi(a), \psi(a') \). This relates a would-be homotopy \( \phi\sim\psi \) specified at a single point, to a point at the end of a path. We will use this to help construct such homotopies.

\end{figure}

\begin{mylemma}\label{lem:addpoints}
Let \( C_n \) be the marked presented polygon 1-type with \( n \) vertices. Then \( C_2\simeq C_1 \) and in fact \( C_n\simeq C_{n-1} \).
\end{mylemma}
\begin{proof}
(Compare to \cite{hottbook} Lemma 6.5.1.) In the case of \( C_1 \) we will denote its constructors by \( \base \) and \( \loopo \). For \( C_2 \) we will denote the points by \( v_1, v_2 \) and the edges by \( \ell_{12}, r_{21} \). For \( C_3 \) and higher we will denote the points by \( v_1,\ldots,v_n \) and the edges by \( e_{i,j}:v_i=v_j \) where \( j=i+1 \) except for \( e_{n,1} \). 

First we will define \( f:C_2\to C_1 \) and \( g:C_1\to C_2 \), then prove they are inverses.
\begin{align*}
f(v_1)=f(v_2)&=\base &\quad g(\base)&=v_1\\
f(\ell_{12})&=\loopo&\quad g(\loopo)&=\ell_{12}\cdot r_{21}\\
f(r_{21}) &= \refl_{\base}& & \\
\end{align*}

We need to show that \( f\circ g\sim \id_{C_1} \) and \( g\circ f\sim\id_{C_2} \).
Think of \( f \) as sliding \( v_2 \) along \( r_{21} \) to coalesce with \( v_1 \). This may help understand why the unfortunately intricate proof is working.

We need terms \( p:\pit{a:C_1}f(g(a))=a \) and \( q:\pit{a:C_2}g(f(a))=a \). We will proceed by induction, defining appropriate paths on point constructors and then checking a condition on path constructors that confirms that the built-in transport of these type families respects the definition on points.

Looking first at \( g\circ f \), which shrinks \( r_{21} \), we have the following data to work with:
\begin{align*}
g(f(v_1))=g(f(v_2))&=v_1\\
g(f(\ell_{12}))&=\ell_{12}\cdot r_{21}\\
g(f(r_{21})) &= \refl_{v_1}.
\end{align*}
We then need to supply a homotopy from this data to \( \id_{C_2} \), which consists of a section and pathovers over \( C_2 \):
\begin{align*}
p_1&:g(f(v_1))=v_1\\
p_2&:g(f(v_1))=v_2\\
H_\ell&:\tr(\ell_{12})(p_1)=p_2\\
H_r&:\tr(r_{21})(p_2)=p_1.
\end{align*}
which simplifies to
\begin{align*}
p_1&:v_1=v_1\\
p_2&:v_1=v_2\\
H_\ell&:g(f(\ell_{12}))^{-1}\cdot p_1\cdot \ell_{12}=p_2\\
H_r&:=g(f(r_{21}))^{-1}\cdot p_2\cdot r_{21}= p_1
\end{align*}
and then to 
\begin{align*}
p_1&:v_1=v_1\\
p_2&:v_1=v_2\\
H_\ell&:(\ell_{12}\cdot r_{21})^{-1}\cdot p_1\cdot \ell_{12}=p_2\\
H_r&:\refl_{v_1}\cdot p_2\cdot r_{21}= p_1
\end{align*}

To solve all of these constraints we can choose \( p_1\defeq\refl_{v_1} \), which by consulting either \( H_\ell \) or \( H_r \) requires that we take \( p_2\defeq{r_{21}}^{-1}\).

Now examining \( f\circ g \), we have
\begin{align*}
f(g(\base))&=\base&\\
f(g(\loopo))&=f(\ell_{12}\cdot r_{21})=\loopo
\end{align*}
and so we have an easy proof that this is the identity.

The proof of the more general case \( C_n \simeq C_{n-1}\) is very similar. Take the maps \( f:C_n\to C_{n-1} \), \( g:C_{n-1}\to C_n \) to be
\begin{align*}
f(v_i)=v_i&\quad(i=1,\ldots,n-1) & g(v_i)&=v_i&\quad(i=1,\ldots,n-1)\\
f(v_n)=v_1&\quad& g(e_{i,i+1})&=e_{i,i+1}&\quad(i=1,\ldots,n-2)\\
f(e_{i,i+1})=e_{i,i+1}&\quad(i=1,\ldots,n-1)& g(e_{n-1,1})&=e_{n-1,n}\cdot e_{n,1}&\\
f(e_{n-1,n})=e_{n-1,1}&&&&\\
f(e_{n,1})=\refl_{v_1}&&&&
\end{align*}
where \( f \) should be thought of as shrinking \( e_{n,1} \) so that \( v_n \) coalesces into \( v_1 \).

The proof that \( g\circ f\sim\id_{C_n} \) proceeds as follows: the composition is definitionally the identity except 
\begin{align*}
g(f(v_n))&=v_1\\
g(f(e_{n-1,n}))&=e_{n-1,n}\cdot e_{n,1}\\
g(f(e_{n,1}))&= \refl_{v_1}.
\end{align*}
Guided by our previous experience we choose \( {e_{n,1}}^{-1}:g(f(v_n))=v_n \), and define the pathovers by transport.

The proof that \( f\circ g\sim\id_{C_{n-1}} \) requires only noting that \( f(g(e_{n-1,1}))=f(e_{n-1,n}\cdot e_{n,1})=e_{n-1,1}\cdot\refl_{v_1}=e_{n-1,1} \).
\end{proof}

\begin{mycor}
\label{cor:gon}
All polygons are equivalent to \( \so \), i.e. we have a term in \( \pit{n:\nn}||C_n=S^1|| \), and hence \( \Gon \) is a subtype of \( \EMzo \).
\end{mycor}
\begin{proof}
We can add \( n-1 \) points to \( S^1 \) and use Lemma~\ref{lem:addpoints}.
\end{proof}

\begin{mydef}
For \( k:\nn \) define \( m_k:\Gon\to\Gon \) where \( m_k:C_n\to C_{kn} \) adds \( k \) vertices between each of the original verticies of \( C_n \).
\end{mydef}

With \( m_k \) we can start with a collection of pentagons and hexagons and make the collection homogeneous: by applying \( m_6 \) to the pentagons and \( m_5 \) to the hexagons we obtain a collection of 30-gons. This will be useful when we work more with the link function.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{The higher inductive type \( \oo \)}{The higher inductive type O}}

We will create our first combinatorial surface, an octahedron. In \( \simcomp \) the combinatorial data of the faces can be represented with a \emph{Hasse diagram}, which shows the poset of inclusions in a graded manner, with a special top and bottom element. We give an octahedron in Figure~\ref{fig:hasse_octohedron}. The names of the vertices are short for white, yellow, blue, red, green, and orange, the colors of the faces of a Rubik's cube. The octahedron is the dual of the cube, with each vertex corresponding to a face.
