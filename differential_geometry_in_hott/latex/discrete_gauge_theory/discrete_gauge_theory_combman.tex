\section{Combinatorial manifolds}

We will adapt to higher inductive types in a straightforward manner the classical construction of \emph{combinatorial manifolds}. See for example the classic book by Kirby and Siebenmann\cite{kirby_siebenmann}. These are a subclass of simplicial complexes.

\begin{mydef}
An \emph{abstract simplicial complex} \( S \) consists of a set \( S_0 \) of vertices, and for each \( k>0 \) a set \( S_k \) of subsets of \( S_0 \) of cardinality \( k+1 \), such that any \( (j+1) \)-element subset of \( S_k \) is an element of \( S_j \).
\end{mydef}

Note that we don't require all subsets of \( S_0 \) to be included -- that would make \( S \) an individual simplex. A simplicial complex is a family of simplices that are identified along various faces.

\begin{mydef}
In an abstract simplicial complex \( X \), the \emph{link} of a vertex \( v \) is the set containing every face \( f\in X \) such that \( v\notin f \) and \( f\cup v \) is a face of \( X \).
\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef}
A \emph{combinatorial manfiold} (or \emph{combinatorial triangulation}) of dimension \( n \) is a simplicial complex of dimension \( n \) such that the link of every vertex is a simplicial sphere of dimension \( n-1 \) (i.e. its geometric realization is homeomorphic to an \( n-1 \)-sphere).
\end{mydef}

In a 2-dimensional combinatorial manifold, the link is the immediate neighbors of \( v \) and the (1-dimensional) edges between them, forming a polygon.

A classical 1940 result of Whitehead, building on Cairn, states that every smooth manifold admits a combinatorial triangulation\cite{whitehead_triangulation}. So it appears reasonably well motivated to study this class of objects.

\subsection{Higher simplicial complexes}

To convert a simplicial complex to a higher inductive type, we will convert the data in each classical dimension to a path constructor of the corresponding HoTT dimension. In order to specify the directionality of all the edges and faces, we need to first choose an ordering for each set in \( S \):

\begin{mydef}
The higher inductive type \( S' \) corresponding to the abstract simplicial complex \( S \) is given by
\begin{enumerate}
\item choosing an order for the elements of each \( S_k \)
\item vertices: a function \( \mathsf{v_0}:S_0\to S' \) serving as the 0-dimensional constructors
\item edges: a function \( \mathsf{v_1}:S_1\to S' \) sending \( \{a, b\}\mapsto \mathsf{v_0}(a)=\mathsf{v_0}(b) \)
\item at dimension \( k \), if \( S_k=\{S_{k1},\ldots,S_{kn}\}\), a path from \( \refl_{S_{k1}} \) to the concatenation \( \mathsf{v_{k-1}}(S_{k1})\cdot\mathsf{v_{k-1}}(S_{k2})\cdot\cdots\cdot\mathsf{v_{k-1}}(S_{kn})) \).
\end{enumerate}
\end{mydef}

Classical constructions such as face maps, degeneracy maps, and boundary will not be needed since homotopy type theory provides related tools (\( \refl \), groupoid operations). Now for some examples.

\subsection{Polygons}

We will begin with a type that is important both for the domain and the codomain of mere circles: a square.

\begin{mydef}
The higher inductive type \( C_4 \) (where C stands for ``circle'').
\begin{align*}
C_4 &: \Type \\
c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4 &: C_4 \\
c_1c_2 &: c_1 = c_2 \\
c_2c_3 &: c_2 = c_3 \\
c_3c_4 &: c_3 = c_4 \\
c_4c_1 &: c_4 = c_1 \\
\end{align*}
\end{mydef}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\input{discrete_gauge_theory_c4_tikz}
\caption{The HIT \( C_4 \).}
\end{figure}

We may also think of \( C_4 \) as the join of the two-element sets \( \{c_1, c_3\}* \{c_2, c_4\} \). The circle itself is a non-example since it lacks the second vertex of the edge:

\begin{mydef}
The higher inductive type \( \so \):
\begin{align*}
\so &:\Type \\
\mathsf{base}&:\so \\
\mathsf{loop}&:\mathsf{base}=\mathsf{base}
\end{align*}
\end{mydef}

\begin{mylemma}
The function \( \ell:C_4\to\so \) given by \( \ell(c_i)=\mathsf{base} \) for all \( i \), and \( \ell(c_ic_j)=\mathsf{loop} \) for all \( i,j \) is an equivalence with inverse \( \ell^{-1}(\mathsf{base})=c_1 \) and \( \ell^{-1}(\mathsf{loop})=c_1c_2\cdot c_2c_3\cdot c_3c_4\cdot c_4c_1 \). There are clearly other inverses for different choices of vertex.
\end{mylemma}

\begin{mycor}
We have \( (C_4,||\ell||_{-1}):\EMzo. \)
\end{mycor}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{The higher inductive type \( \oo \)}{The higher inductive type O}}

We will create our first combinatorial manifold, a 2-sphere. We will adopt the convention that a subscript indicates the dimension of a subskeleton of a complex. For instance, we have \( \mathsf{base}:\so_0 \).

\begin{mydef}
The HIT \( \oo_0 \) is just 6 points, intended as the 0-skeleton of an octahedron, with vertices named after the colors on the faces of a puzzle cube.
\[ w, y, b, r, g, o : \oo_0 \]
\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef}
The HIT \( \oo_1 \) is the 1-skeleton of an octahedron.
\begin{align*}
w, y, b, r, g, o &: \oo_1 & yg &: y=g \\
wb &: w=b & yo &: y=o \\
wr &: w=r & br &: b=r \\
wg &: w=g & rg &: r=g \\
wo &: w=o & go &: g=o \\
yb &: y=b & ob &: o=b \\
yr &: y=r
\end{align*}
\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef}
The HIT \( \oo \) is an octahedron:
\begin{align*}
w, y, b, r, g, o &: \oo \\
wb &: w=b & br &: b=r & wbr &: wb\cdot br\cdot wr^{-1} = \refl_w \\
wr &: w=r & rg &: r=g & wrg &: wr\cdot rg\cdot wg^{-1} = \refl_w \\
wg &: w=g & go &: g=o & wgo &: wg\cdot go\cdot wo^{-1} = \refl_w \\
wo &: w=o & ob &: o=b & wob &: wo\cdot ob\cdot wb^{-1} = \refl_w \\
yb &: y=b & & & yrb &: yr\cdot rb\cdot yb^{-1} = \refl_y \\
yr &: y=r & & & ygr &: yg\cdot gr\cdot yr^{-1} = \refl_y \\
yg &: y=g & & & yog &: yo\cdot og\cdot yg^{-1} = \refl_y \\
yo &: y=o & & & ybo &: yb\cdot bo\cdot yo^{-1} = \refl_y 
\end{align*}
\end{mydef}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\input{discrete_gauge_theory_oo_tikz}
\caption{The HIT \( \oo \) which has 6 points, 12 1-paths, 8 2-paths.}
\end{figure}

We have obvious maps \( \oo_0\xrightarrow[]{i_0} \oo_1\xrightarrow[]{i_1} \oo \) that include each skeleton into the next-higher-dimensional skeleton.

\subsection{The function \texorpdfstring{\( \link \)}{link}}

Taking the link of a vertex gives us a map to the universe.

\begin{mydef}
\( \link:\oo_0\to\BAut C_4 \) is given by induction:
\begin{align*}
\link(w) &= brgo & \link(r) &= wbyg \\
\link(y) &= bogr & \link(g) &= wryo \\
\link(b) &= woyr & \link(o) &= wgyb
\end{align*}
We chose these orderings for the vertices in the link, by visualizing standing at the given vertex as if it were the north pole, then looking south and enumerating the link in clockwise order, starting from \( w \) if possible, else \( b \).
\end{mydef}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\input{discrete_gauge_theory_oo_transport_tikz}
\caption{\( \link \) for the verticies \( w, b\) and \( r \).}
\label{fig:triangle_of_equators}
\end{figure}

To extend \( \link \) to the 1-skeleton, imagine how \( \link \) changes as we slide from point to point. Sliding from \( w \) to \( b \) and tipping the link as we go, we see \( r\mapsto r \) and \( o\mapsto o \) because those lie on the axis of rotation. Then \( g\mapsto w \) and \( b\mapsto y \). 

The full map on the 1-skeleton is:
\begin{mydef}
Define \( T_1:\oo_1\to\BAut C_4 \) on just the 1-skeleton by extending \( \link \) as follows:
Transport away from \( w \):
\begin{itemize}
\item \( T_1(wb):[b, r, g, o]\mapsto [y, r, w, o] \) (\( r, o \) fixed)
\item \( T_1(wr):[b, r, g, o]\mapsto [b, y, g, w] \) (\( b, g \) fixed)
\item \( T_1(wg):[b, r, g, o]\mapsto [w, r, y, o] \)
\item \( T_1(wo):[b, r, g, o]\mapsto [b, w, g, y] \)
\end{itemize}
Transport away from \( y \):
\begin{itemize}
\item \( T_1(yb):[b, o, g, r]\mapsto [w, o, y, r] \)
\item \( T_1(yr):[b, o, g, r]\mapsto [b, y, g, w] \)
\item \( T_1(yg):[b, o, g, r]\mapsto [y, o, w, r] \)
\item \( T_1(yo):[b, o, g, r]\mapsto [b, w, g, y] \)
\end{itemize}
Transport along the equator:
\begin{itemize}
\item \( T_1(br):[w, o, y, r]\mapsto [w, b, y, g] \) 
\item \( T_1(rg):[w, b, y, g]\mapsto [w, r, y, o] \)
\item \( T_1(go):[w, r, y, o]\mapsto [w, g, y, b] \)
\item \( T_1(ob):[w, g, y, b]\mapsto [w, o, y, r] \)
\end{itemize}
\end{mydef}

It's very important to be able to visualize what \( T_1 \) does to triangular paths such as \( wb\cdot br\cdot rw \) (which circulates around the boundary of face \( wbr \)). You can see it if you imagine Figure~\ref{fig:triangle_of_equators} as the frames of a short movie. Or you can place your palm over the top of a cube and note where your fingers are pointing, then slide your hand to an equatorial face, then along the equator, then back to the top. The answer is: you come back rotated clockwise by a quarter-turn. 

\begin{mydef}
The map \( R:C_4\to C_4 \) rotates by one quarter turn, one ``click":
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
\item \( R(c_1) = c_2 \)
\item \( R(c_2) = c_3 \)
\item \( R(c_3) = c_4 \)
\item \( R(c_4) = c_1 \)
\item \( R(c_1c_2) = c_2c_3 \)
\item \( R(c_2c_3) = c_3c_4 \)
\item \( R(c_3c_4) = c_4c_1 \)
\item \( R(c_4c_1) = c_1c_2 \)
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}
\end{mydef}

Now let's extend \( T_1 \) to all of \( \oo \) by providing values for the eight faces. The face \( wbr \) is a path from \( \refl_w \) to the concatenation \( wb\cdot br\cdot rw \), and so the image of \( wbr \) under the extended version of \( T_1 \) must be a homotopy from \( \refl_{T_1(w)} \) to \( T_1(wb\cdot br\cdot rw) \).

\begin{mydef}
Define \( T_2:\oo\to\BAut C_4 \) by extending \( T_1 \) to the faces as follows:
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
\item \( T_2(wbr)=H_R \) 
\item \( T_2(wrg)=H_R \)
\item \( T_2(wgo)=H_R \)
\item \( T_2(ybo)=H_R \)
\item \( T_2(yrb)=H_R \) 
\item \( T_2(ygr)=H_R \)
\item \( T_2(yog)=H_R \)
\item \( T_2(ybo)=H_R \)
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}
where \( H_R:R=\refl \) is the obvious homotopy.
\end{mydef}

All the faces do the same thing: they map to a homotopy between the identity and clockwise rotation by a quarter turn. Concatenating the eight faces in the 2-groupoid \( \oo \) would then map to a homotopy between the identity and two full rotations. This makes visible in HoTT the link between curvature and the Euler characteristic (which is 2 for the octahedron).

\subsection{The torus}

We can define a combinatorial torus as a similar HIT. This time each vertex will have six neighbors. So all the links will be merely equal to \( C_6 \) which is a hexagonal version of \( C_4 \). See Figure~\ref{fig:torus}. 

To help parse this figure, imagine instead Figure~\ref{fig:flattorus}. We take this simple alternating-triangle pattern, then glue the left and right edges, then bend into Figure~\ref{fig:torus}. The fact that each column in Figure~\ref{fig:flattorus} has four dots corresponds to the torus in Figure~\ref{fig:torus} having a square in front, diamonds in the middle, and a square in back.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\input{discrete_gauge_theory_torus_tikz}
\caption{Torus embedded in 3-dimensional space. Black lines trace four square-shaped paths, red ones connect the front square to the middle diamonds, and blue ones connect the back path to the middle ones.}
\label{fig:torus}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\input{discrete_gauge_theory_torusflat_tikz}
\caption{An inspiration for the torus. Identify the sides and then the top, definitionally, to get the actual torus.}
\label{fig:flattorus}
\end{figure}

It's a bit of a challenge to visualize how the connection should twist these links as we move around. Part of the issue is that we have actually constrained ourselves quite a bit by requiring the tangent space to be the link of a point, which only has six points. We could be more precise about angles if the tangent spaces had many subdivisions of the circle. The way to achieve better approximations, which we will not pursue in this paper, is to \emph{refine} a given triangulation, and then choose a contractible neighborhood for each point which is not the link but goes ``farther out'' and consists of many edges and encloses many triangles. We could then transport along a single edge, and map between two circles that each have many segments, approximating to arbitrary precision any real-world application. The theory and practice of refinements is extensive and includes computer graphics research.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\input{discrete_gauge_theory_torus_tr_frame2_tikz}
\input{discrete_gauge_theory_torus_tr_frame3_tikz}
\input{discrete_gauge_theory_torus_tr_frame4_tikz}
\input{discrete_gauge_theory_torus_tr_frame5_tikz}
\caption{This shows the transport map along the top triangle, in the counterclockwise direction. The first transport is twistier than along other edges: it pivots the hexagon around the top of the outer diamond. The net effect of the three stages is to rotate the original hexagon by one notch counterclockwise.}
\label{fig:torus_twist}
\end{figure}

Transport along geodesics is minimal in a technical sense, meaning the least twisty. If we use the flat torus diagram to help us, then we can identify the outer and inner diamond, which are three of the vertical black lines, as geodesics, as well as all of the diagonal lines, which are the ones in Figure~\ref{fig:torus_geodesic}. That leaves only the black vertical lines that go around the front and back squares. Those are not geodesics, and some twisting will take place there.

I am talking about twisting on individual edges, but that's not a concept with standalone meaning since the hexagons are torsors. I'm impicitly using the flat torus to makes the hexagons all pointed, by pointing them at the top as they appear in Figure~\ref{fig:flattorus}. But let's not use that extra information, and instead let's start talking about loops around faces.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=200pt]{dense_circle.png}
\caption{To better approximate small transport angles, we would refine the mesh and instead of the link we would use circle-like paths that include more triangles, and have many edges. Imagine transporting the blue circle around the triangle indicated in the center. The point on the circle might move through the path shown, indicating how the circle comes back rotated just a few degrees counterclockwise. Use your imagination to discretize the smooth circle onto the points of the mesh.}
