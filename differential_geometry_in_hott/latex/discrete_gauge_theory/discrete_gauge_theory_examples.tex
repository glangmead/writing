\end{enumerate}
\subsection{The octahedron}

We will define some higher inductive types to serve as domain and codomain of these motivating examples.

\subsubsection{The higher inductive type \( \oo \)}

First we need a square, which will be a stand-in for a circle that can support a notion of a quarter-rotation. 

\begin{mydef}
The higher inductive type \( C_4 \) (where C stands for ``circle'').
\begin{align*}
C_4 &: \Type \\
c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4 &: C_4 \\
c_1c_2 &: c_1 = c_2 \\
c_2c_3 &: c_2 = c_3 \\
c_3c_4 &: c_3 = c_4 \\
c_4c_1 &: c_4 = c_1 \\
\end{align*}
\end{mydef}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\input{discrete_gauge_theory_c4_tikz}
\caption{The HIT \( C_4 \).}
\end{figure}

We may also think of \( C_4 \) as the join of the two-element sets \( \{c_1, c_3\}* \{c_2, c_4\} \).

\begin{mydef}
The HIT \( \oo_0 \) is just 6 points, intended as the 0-skeleton of an octahedron, with vertices named after the colors on the faces of a Rubik's Cube.
\[ w, y, b, r, g, o : \oo_0 \]
\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef}
The HIT \( \oo_1 \) is the 1-skeleton of an octahedron.
\begin{align*}
w, y, b, r, g, o &: \oo_1 \\
wb &: w=b \\
wr &: w=r \\
wg &: w=g \\
wo &: w=o \\
yb &: y=b \\
yr &: y=r \\
yg &: y=g \\
yo &: y=o \\
br &: b=r \\
rg &: r=g \\
go &: g=o \\
ob &: o=b 
\end{align*}
\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef}
The HIT \( \oo \) is an octahedron:
\begin{align*}
w, y, b, r, g, o &: \oo \\
wb &: w=b \\
wr &: w=r \\
wg &: w=g \\
wo &: w=o \\
yb &: y=b \\
yr &: y=r \\
yg &: y=g \\
yo &: y=o \\
br &: b=r \\
rg &: r=g \\
go &: g=o \\
ob &: o=b \\
wbr &: wb\cdot br\cdot wr^{-1} = \refl_w \\
wrg &: wr\cdot rg\cdot wg^{-1} = \refl_w \\
wgo &: wg\cdot go\cdot wo^{-1} = \refl_w \\
wob &: wo\cdot ob\cdot wb^{-1} = \refl_w \\
yrb &: yr\cdot rb\cdot yb^{-1} = \refl_y \\
ygr &: yg\cdot gr\cdot yr^{-1} = \refl_y \\
yog &: yo\cdot og\cdot yg^{-1} = \refl_y \\
ybo &: yb\cdot bo\cdot yo^{-1} = \refl_y
\end{align*}
\end{mydef}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\input{discrete_gauge_theory_oo_tikz}
\caption{The HIT \( \oo \) which has 6 points, 12 1-paths, 8 2-paths.}
\end{figure}

We have obvious maps \( \oo_0\xrightarrow[]{i_0} \oo_1\xrightarrow[]{i_1} \oo \) that include each skeleton into the next-higher-dimensional skeleton.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\( \link \), \( \xbox \), and \( \xdisk \)}{link, xbox, and xdisk}}

Here we'll define combinatorial versions of tangent spaces and tangent circles, in the special case where every vertex has four neighbors.

Combinatorial spaces have a concept called the \emph{link} of a vertex, which will be the main tool by which we connect with manifold theory. The vertices in the link are the vertices that are one edge away from the given point (its immediate neighbors), and the edges in the link are the edges connecting the neighbors to each other. If the link of an \( n \)-dimensional combinatorial space is always a combinatorial \( n-1 \)-sphere, then we say the space is a \emph{combinatorial triangulation}. We will look only at HITs that have a link that is merely equivalent to \( C_4 \). So first we need notation for a connected component of the universe:

\begin{mydef}
If we have \( X:\Type \) then we define \( \BAut X\defeq \sit{Y:\Type} ||X=Y||_{-1} \). 
\end{mydef}

Denote by \( abcd:\BAut C_4 \) the HIT with vertices \( a, b, c, d \) and edges \( ab, bc, cd, da \) which clearly has various isomorphisms with \( C_4 \).

We can now define a map \( \link:\oo_0\to\BAut C_4 \). Extending this later on to the 1-skeleton and 2-skeleton will take us into differential geometry!

\begin{mydef}
\( \link:\oo_0\to\BAut C_4 \) is given by induction:
\begin{align*}
\link(w) &= brgo \\
\link(y) &= bogr \\
\link(b) &= woyr \\
\link(r) &= wbyg \\
\link(g) &= wryo \\
\link(o) &= wgyb
\end{align*}
We chose these orderings for the vertices by standing at the given vertex and enumerating the link in clockwise order, starting from \( w \) if possible, else \( b \).
\end{mydef}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\input{discrete_gauge_theory_oo_transport_tikz}
\caption{\( \link \) for the verticies \( w, b\) and \( r \).}
\label{fig:triangle_of_equators}
\end{figure}

Besides the link we also want to consider the 5-pointed object that includes the vertex itself and the edges connecting it to the vertices in the link. We will call such a shape an \emph{xbox} since it is a square with both diagonals. We will denote xboxes by extending the square notation with a fifth letter to indicate the center of the xbox. For example, we can define an xbox \( C_{4c} \) as follows:

\begin{mydef}
The higher inductive type \( C_{4c} \) with center \( c \), also denoted \( c_1c_2c_3c_4c \).
\begin{align*}
C_{4c} &: \Type \\
c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c &: C_{4c} \\
c_1c_2 &: c_1 = c_2 \\
c_2c_3 &: c_2 = c_3 \\
c_3c_4 &: c_3 = c_4 \\
c_4c_1 &: c_4 = c_1 \\
c_1c &: c_1 = c \\
c_2c &: c_2 = c \\
c_3c &: c_3 = c \\
c_4c &: c_4 = c 
\end{align*}
\end{mydef}

And we get a map \( \xbox:\oo_0\to\Type \) similarly to \( \link \).
\begin{mydef}
\( \xbox:\oo_0\to\BAut C_{4c} \) is given by induction:
\begin{align*}
\xbox(w) &= brgow \\
\xbox(y) &= bogry \\
\xbox(b) &= woyrb \\
\xbox(r) &= wbygr \\
\xbox(g) &= wryog \\
\xbox(o) &= wgybo
\end{align*}
\end{mydef}

Finally we want to consider the 2-type that fills in the faces of the xbox. This is a contractible type we will call an \emph{xdisk}. 

\begin{mydef}
The higher inductive type \( C_{4c\xdisk} \) with center \( c \), also denoted \( c_1c_2c_3c_4c_\xdisk \).
\begin{align*}
C_{4c\xdisk} &: \Type \\
c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c &: C_{4c\xdisk} \\
c_1c_2 &: c_1 = c_2 \\
c_2c_3 &: c_2 = c_3 \\
c_3c_4 &: c_3 = c_4 \\
c_4c_1 &: c_4 = c_1 \\
c_1c &: c_1 = c \\
c_2c &: c_2 = c \\
c_3c &: c_3 = c \\
c_4c &: c_4 = c \\
c_1c_2c &: c_1c_2\cdot c_2c\cdot c_1c^{-1} = \refl \\
c_2c_3c &: c_2c_2\cdot c_3c\cdot c_2c^{-1} = \refl \\
c_3c_4c &: c_3c_2\cdot c_4c\cdot c_3c^{-1} = \refl \\
c_4c_1c &: c_4c_2\cdot c_1c\cdot c_4c^{-1} = \refl
\end{align*}
\end{mydef}

We can define \( \xdisk:\oo_0\to\BAut C_{4c\xdisk} \) by filling in the triangles in \( \xbox \).

\begin{mydef}
\( \xdisk:\oo_0\to\BAut C_{4c\xdisk} \) is given by induction:
\begin{align*}
\xbox(w) &= brgow_\xdisk \\
\xbox(y) &= bogry_\xdisk \\
\xbox(b) &= woyrb_\xdisk \\
\xbox(r) &= wbygr_\xdisk \\
\xbox(g) &= wryog_\xdisk \\
\xbox(o) &= wgybo_\xdisk
\end{align*}
\end{mydef}

\subsubsection{Extending \texorpdfstring{\( \link \)}{link}}

Note that \( \BAut C_4 \) is of homotopy dimension at least 2, just as \( \oo \) is. The paths are isomorphisms between types that are merely equivalent to squares, and the 2-paths are homotopies between these. We can make further use of Figure~\ref{fig:triangle_of_equators} by imagining how \( \link \) changes as we slide from point to point. Sliding from \( w \) to \( b \) and tipping the link as we go, we see \( r\mapsto r \) and \( o\mapsto o \) because those lie on the axis of rotation. Then \( g\mapsto w \) and \( b\mapsto y \). 

The full map on the 1-skeleton is:
\begin{mydef}
Define \( T_1:\oo\to\BAut C_4 \) on just the 1-skeleton by extending \( \link \) as follows:
Transport away from \( w \):
\begin{itemize}
\item \( T_1(wb):[b, r, g, o]\mapsto [y, r, w, o] \) (\( r, o \) fixed)
\item \( T_1(wr):[b, r, g, o]\mapsto [b, y, g, w] \) (\( b, g \) fixed)
\item \( T_1(wg):[b, r, g, o]\mapsto [w, r, y, o] \)
\item \( T_1(wo):[b, r, g, o]\mapsto [b, w, g, y] \)
\end{itemize}
Transport away from \( y \):
\begin{itemize}
\item \( T_1(yb):[b, o, g, r]\mapsto [w, o, y, r] \)
\item \( T_1(yr):[b, o, g, r]\mapsto [b, y, g, w] \)
\item \( T_1(yg):[b, o, g, r]\mapsto [y, o, w, r] \)
\item \( T_1(yo):[b, o, g, r]\mapsto [b, w, g, y] \)
\end{itemize}
Transport along the equator:
\begin{itemize}
\item \( T_1(br):[w, o, y, r]\mapsto [w, b, y, g] \) 
\item \( T_1(rg):[w, b, y, g]\mapsto [w, r, y, o] \)
\item \( T_1(go):[w, r, y, o]\mapsto [w, g, y, b] \)
\item \( T_1(ob):[w, g, y, b]\mapsto [w, o, y, r] \)
\end{itemize}
\end{mydef}

It's very important to be able to visualize what \( T_1 \) does to triangular paths such as \( wb\cdot br\cdot rw \) (which circulates around the boundary of face \( wbr \)). You can see it if you imagine Figure~\ref{fig:triangle_of_equators} as the frames of a short movie. Or you can place your palm over the top of a cube and note where your fingers are pointing, then slide your hand to an equatorial face, then along the equator, then back to the top. The answer is: you come back rotated clockwise by a quarter-turn. 

\begin{mydef}
The map \( R:C_4\to C_4 \) rotates by one quarter turn, one ``click":
\begin{itemize}
\item \( R(c_1) = c_2 \)
\item \( R(c_2) = c_3 \)
\item \( R(c_3) = c_4 \)
\item \( R(c_4) = c_1 \)
\item \( R(c_1c_2) = c_2c_3 \)
\item \( R(c_2c_3) = c_3c_4 \)
\item \( R(c_3c_4) = c_4c_1 \)
\item \( R(c_4c_1) = c_1c_2 \)
\end{itemize}
\end{mydef}

Now let's extend \( T_1 \) to all of \( \oo \) by providing values for the eight faces. The face \( wbr \) is a path from \( \refl_w \) to the concatenation \( wb\cdot br\cdot rw \), and so the image of \( wbr \) under the extended version of \( T_1 \) must be a homotopy from \( \refl_{T_1(w)} \) to \( T_1(wb\cdot br\cdot rw) \).

\begin{mydef}
Define \( T_2:\oo\to\BAut C_4 \) by extending \( T_1 \) to the faces as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \( T_2(wbr)=H_R \) 
\item \( T_2(wrg)=H_R \)
\item \( T_2(wgo)=H_R \)
\item \( T_2(ybo)=H_R \)
\item \( T_2(yrb)=H_R \) 
\item \( T_2(ygr)=H_R \)
\item \( T_2(yog)=H_R \)
\item \( T_2(ybo)=H_R \)
\end{itemize}
where \( H_R:R=\refl \) is the obvious homotopy.
\end{mydef}

All the faces do the same thing: they map to a homotopy between the identity and clockwise rotation by a quarter turn. Concatenating the eight faces in the 2-groupoid \( \oo \) would then map to a homotopy between the identity and two full rotations. This makes visible in HoTT the link between curvature and the euler characteristic (which is 2 for the octahedron).

\subsection{The torus}

We can define a combinatorial torus as a similar HIT. This time each vertex will have six neighbors. So all the links will be merely equal to \( C_6 \) which is a hexagonal version of \( C_4 \). See Figure~\ref{fig:torus}. 

To help parse this figure, imagine instead Figure~\ref{fig:flattorus}. We take this simple alternating-triangle pattern, then glue the left and right edges, then bend into Figure~\ref{fig:torus}. The fact that each column in Figure~\ref{fig:flattorus} has four dots corresponds to the torus in Figure~\ref{fig:torus} having a square in front, diamonds in the middle, and a square in back.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\input{discrete_gauge_theory_torus_tikz}
\caption{Torus embedded in 3-dimensional space. Black lines trace four square-shaped paths, red ones connect the front square to the middle diamonds, and blue ones connect the back path to the middle ones.}
\label{fig:torus}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\input{discrete_gauge_theory_torusflat_tikz}
\caption{An inspiration for the torus. Identify the sides and then the top, definitionally, to get the actual torus.}
\label{fig:flattorus}
\end{figure}

It's a bit of a challenge to visualize how the connection should twist these ``xhexes'' as we move around. Part of the issue is that we have actually constrained ourselves quite a bit by requiring the tangent space to be the link itself, which only has six settings. We could be more precise about angles if the tangent spaces had many subdivisions of the circle. If we had an actual application in mind then we might do that, but for now we'll be content to operate more conceptually.

Given an arbitrary edge on the 3d-embedded torus, how should we decide how to map the hexagons at the endpoints? The goal is of course to approximate the actual geometry of transport on a curved torus, so we should learn a little about that. Which is comforting -- we're trying to capture geometry, so it's good that we need to use some!

Of all the edges on our shape, the ones that are not very similar to geodesics are the squares in front and back. The two diamonds clearly correspond to highly symmetric geodesics, and less clearly there are four other cycles that are close enough to geodesics that if we drew the edges curved, they'd be actual geodesics on the torus they were hugging (Figure~\ref{fig:torus_geodesic}).


\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.3]{torus_geodesic.png}
\caption{A geodesic on a torus with inner radius 1 and outer radius 3.}
\label{fig:torus_geodesic_smooth}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\input{discrete_gauge_theory_torus_tr_frame1_tikz}
\caption{This path is very similar to an actual geodesic on an actual torus. There are three other analogous ones, one that also passes through the top and bottom of the outer diamond, and two that are 90 degree rotations of those two.}
\label{fig:torus_geodesic}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\input{discrete_gauge_theory_torus_tr_frame2_tikz}
\input{discrete_gauge_theory_torus_tr_frame3_tikz}
\caption{This shows the transport map along the top of the front square. It is twistier than along other edges. It pivots the hexagon around the top of the outer diamond.}
\label{fig:torus_twist}
\end{figure}

Transport along geodesics is minimal in a technical sense, meaning the least twisty. If we use the flat torus diagram to help us, then we can identify the outer and inner diamond, which are three of the vertical black lines, as geodesics, as well as all of the diagonal lines, which are the ones in Figure~\ref{fig:torus_geodesic}. That leaves only the black vertical lines that go around the front and back squares. Those are not geodesics, and some twisting will take place there.

I am talking about twisting on individual edges, but that's not a concept with standalone meaning since the hexagons are torsors. I'm impicitly using the flat torus to makes the hexagons all pointed, by pointing them at the top as they appear in Figure~\ref{fig:flattorus}. But let's not use that extra information, and instead let's start talking about loops around faces.


\subsection{Combinatorial manifolds}

(This section is not quite off the ground.)

The combinatorial structure we have in mind is a nerve of a good open cover. What do we know about which smooth manifolds have such covers? While we're at it, let's survey all the combinatorial-flavored spaces and survey what smooth manifolds are homotopy equivalent to which structures.

What topological manifolds are equivalent to a CW complex? The answer is the composition of a few results summarized by Allen Hatcher\footnote{\url{https://mathoverflow.net/questions/201944/topological-n-manifolds-have-the-homotopy-type-of-n-dimensional-cw-complexes}} (citing \cite{kirby_siebenmann} and \cite{freedman_quinn}):

\begin{quote}
Every topological manifold has a handlebody structure except in dimension 4, where a 4-manifold has a handlebody structure if and only if it is smoothable. This is a theorem on page 136 of Freedman and Quinn's book ``Topology of 4-Manifolds'', with a reference given to the Kirby-Siebenmann book for the higher-dimensional case. It is then an elementary fact that an \( n \)-manifold with a handlebody structure is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex with one \( k \)-cell for each \( k \)-handle, so in particular there are no cells of dimension greater than \( n \). At least in the compact case a manifold with a handlebody structure is in fact homeomorphic to a CW complex with \( k \)-cells corresponding to \( k \)-handles; see page 107 of Kirby-Siebenmann. This probably holds in the noncompact case as well, though I don't know a reference.
\end{quote}
