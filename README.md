# My technical writing

"susydonaldson" is my Ph.D. thesis about 4-dimensional smooth invariants that arose from physics.

"connections" is a series of lectures about connections on a principal bundle, Chern-Weil theory, and possibly the type theory thereof!

"randomness" contains papers for the CMU course "Seminar on Algorithmic Randomness" 80-817 in Fall 2020.
