# My technical writing

"susydonaldson" is my Ph.D. thesis about 4-dimensional smooth invariants that arose from physics.

"smoothness" is my current research at CMU about defining differential geometry in the setting of modal homotopy type theory.

"connections" is a series of lectures about connections on a principal bundle, Chern-Weil theory, and possibly the type theory thereof!
