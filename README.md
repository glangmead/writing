# My technical writing

`differential_geometry_in_hott` contains work for my masters thesis, including some early attempts at formalization. It is [posted here](http://greg.langmead.info/writing/towards_gauge_theory_in_hott/).

`susydonaldson` is my Ph.D. thesis about 4-dimensional smooth invariants that arose from physics. It is [posted here](http://greg.langmead.info/writing/susydonaldson/).

`connections` is a series of lectures about connections on a principal bundle, Chern-Weil theory, and possibly the type theory thereof. It tries to work directly with smoothness, an approach I later discarded. It is [posted here](http://greg.langmead.info/writing/smoothness/).

`randomness` contains papers for the CMU course "Seminar on Algorithmic Randomness" 80-817 in Fall 2020. It is [posted here](http://greg.langmead.info/writing/randomness/).

`frege_russell` is writing for an independent study of the early history of logic. It is [posted here](http://greg.langmead.info/writing/frege/).
